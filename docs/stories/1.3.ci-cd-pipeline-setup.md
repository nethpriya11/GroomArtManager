# Story 1.3: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** development team,
**I want** automated testing and deployment pipelines,
**so that** code quality is maintained and deployments are reliable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) created
2. **Test job** runs on all pushes/PRs: ESLint, Prettier check, TypeScript type-check, unit tests (Vitest), build
3. **E2E job** runs on main branch only: Start emulators, run Playwright tests
4. **Deploy job** runs on main branch only after tests pass: Deploy to Vercel, deploy Firestore rules
5. Vercel project connected to GitHub repository
6. Deployment configured for automatic deploys on main branch push
7. Preview deployments configured for all PRs
8. Husky pre-commit hook configured with lint-staged (runs ESLint + Prettier on staged files)
9. Status checks required for PR merges (tests must pass)
10. First successful deployment to Vercel completes with health check passing

## Dev Notes

### CI/CD Architecture

[Source: architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]

**CI/CD Stack:**

- **CI:** GitHub Actions (free for public repos, integrated with GitHub)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (optimized for Next.js, automatic preview deployments)
- **Infrastructure Deployment:** Firebase CLI (Firestore rules and indexes)

**Deployment Flow:**

1. Developer pushes code to branch
2. GitHub Actions runs Test job (all branches/PRs)
3. If main branch: E2E job runs with Firebase Emulators
4. If tests pass on main: Deploy job deploys to Vercel + Firebase
5. For PRs: Vercel creates preview deployment automatically

### GitHub Actions Workflow Structure

[Source: architecture.md#High Level Architecture]

**Jobs:**

1. **test:** Runs on all pushes/PRs (linting, type-check, unit tests, build)
2. **e2e:** Runs only on main branch (E2E tests with emulators)
3. **deploy:** Runs only on main branch after tests pass (Vercel + Firebase deployment)

**Environment Variables Needed:**

- VERCEL_TOKEN (Vercel authentication)
- VERCEL_ORG_ID (Vercel organization ID)
- VERCEL_PROJECT_ID (Vercel project ID)
- FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT (Firebase Admin SDK credentials)

### Test Job Commands

[Source: architecture.md#Coding Standards]

**Package.json Scripts Required:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "format:check": "prettier --check .",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:watch": "vitest",
    "test:e2e": "playwright test",
    "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"
  }
}
```

**Test Sequence:**

1. ESLint: Checks code quality and Next.js/TypeScript best practices
2. Prettier: Ensures consistent code formatting
3. TypeScript: Type-checks entire codebase without emitting files
4. Vitest: Runs unit and component tests
5. Build: Verifies production build succeeds

### E2E Job Configuration

[Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]

**Firebase Emulator Setup in CI:**

```yaml
- name: Start Firebase Emulators
  run: |
    firebase emulators:start --only firestore,auth &
    sleep 10  # Wait for emulators to initialize

- name: Seed Test Data
  run: pnpm run seed:dev

- name: Run E2E Tests
  run: pnpm test:e2e
```

**Playwright Configuration:**

- Browsers: Chromium (primary), Firefox, WebKit
- Parallelization: 3 workers in CI
- Retries: 2 retries on failure
- Video: On failure only
- Screenshots: On failure only

### Husky + lint-staged Configuration

[Source: architecture.md#Coding Standards]

**Pre-commit Hook (.husky/pre-commit):**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

pnpm exec lint-staged
```

**lint-staged Configuration (package.json):**

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
    "*.{json,md,css}": ["prettier --write"]
  }
}
```

### Vercel Deployment Configuration

[Source: architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]

**Vercel Project Settings:**

- Framework: Next.js
- Build Command: `pnpm build`
- Output Directory: `.next`
- Install Command: `pnpm install`
- Development Command: `pnpm dev`
- Node.js Version: 20.x (from .nvmrc)

**Environment Variables in Vercel:**

- All NEXT*PUBLIC*\* variables from .env.local
- Production and Preview environments configured separately

### Branch Protection Rules

[Source: architecture.md#CI/CD]

**Required Status Checks:**

- test (GitHub Actions Test job)
- e2e (GitHub Actions E2E job)

**Additional Rules:**

- Require pull request reviews before merging (recommended: 1 approval)
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed

### Testing

[Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]

**For This Story:**

- No unit tests required (infrastructure setup)
- Validation steps:
  1. Verify GitHub Actions workflow file is valid YAML
  2. Verify Test job runs on PR and passes all checks
  3. Verify E2E job runs only on main branch
  4. Verify Deploy job runs only on main after tests pass
  5. Verify Husky pre-commit hook blocks commits with lint errors
  6. Verify Vercel preview deployment created for PR
  7. Verify Vercel production deployment succeeds on main push
  8. Verify deployed app is accessible and loads correctly
  9. Verify Firestore rules deployed successfully
  10. Verify branch protection prevents merging failing PRs

**Monitoring:**

- Check GitHub Actions logs for each workflow run
- Monitor Vercel dashboard for deployment status
- Use Vercel Analytics for production health checks
