# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Streamline salon service logging and reduce manual paperwork for barbers and managers
- Implement transparent commission tracking and approval workflow for barber compensation
- Provide real-time financial visibility and performance metrics for business decision-making
- Enable efficient team management with centralized barber and service CRUD operations
- Deliver role-based access control ensuring appropriate permissions for managers and barbers
- Create an intuitive, modern interface that works seamlessly across devices

## Background Context

Traditional barbershop operations often rely on paper-based service logs, manual commission calculations, and disconnected systems for tracking performance. This creates inefficiencies, potential errors in commission payouts, and limited visibility into business metrics. Barbers lack transparency into their earnings status, while managers struggle to oversee operations and make data-driven decisions.

SalonFlow addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, real-time platform where barbers can log completed services for approval, managers can oversee all operations through a comprehensive dashboard, and both roles benefit from instant access to relevant data. The system eliminates paperwork, reduces disputes through transparent approval workflows, and empowers salon owners with actionable insights through performance leaderboards and financial reporting.
