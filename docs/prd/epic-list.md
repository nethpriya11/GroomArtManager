# Epic List

**Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication**
Establish project infrastructure (Next.js App Router, Firebase, TypeScript, Tailwind, ShadCN), implement role-based authentication flow (manager/barber selection), create dashboard shells with navigation, set up CI/CD pipeline, and configure basic real-time infrastructure to provide a deployable foundation with working authentication.

**Epic 2: Core Data Management (Services & Barbers)**
Enable managers to create, read, update, and delete both services (name, price, duration) and barbers (username, avatar, commission rate) with full CRUD UI, display catalogs to appropriate roles with real-time updates, and implement form validation and delete protections, delivering a complete salon configuration system.

**Epic 3: Service Logging & Approval Workflow**
Build the end-to-end workflow where barbers log completed services (multi-select), service logs enter pending status, managers review and approve/reject via dashboard, commission calculations occur automatically, real-time updates propagate across clients, and both roles can track service history, delivering the core value proposition of transparent commission management.

**Epic 4: Reporting & Analytics**
Create comprehensive reporting features including dashboard KPIs (revenue, services, active barbers), performance leaderboards (barbers and services), detailed financial ledger with commission breakdowns, date range filtering, and search functionality, delivering actionable business insights for data-driven salon management.
