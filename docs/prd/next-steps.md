- Interaction flows and state transitions
- Responsive design breakpoints and mobile adaptations
- Accessibility implementation guidance (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
- Design system documentation (colors, typography, spacing, component variants)

Focus on the dark theme aesthetic with #0a0a0a backgrounds and #f59e0b amber accents, ensuring all UI elements meet contrast requirements and provide excellent usability for both manager and barber roles.

## Architect Prompt

Review the SalonFlow PRD (docs/prd.md) and create comprehensive technical architecture documentation including:
